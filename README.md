# MinerBlock

A Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.21.4.

Adds the _Miner_, an inverse to the Crafter that allows for vanilla-friendly automining. Made of copper, redstone, wooden planks, and a dispenser, the Miner lets players insert tools and break blocks using redstone signals.

## Overview

- The Miner begins empty but can be filled by right clicking with a pickaxe, axe, shovel, or hoe.
- If the Miner is facing a block and the inserted tool is meant to mine that block, it will use the tool to mine whatever is ahead of it.
- The Miner mines just like a player; it applies the tool's enchantments and damages it accordingly. It will not use a tool that is at one durability so as to avoid it breaking.
- The Miner will give a full-strength comparator output if it is both filled and the inserted tool is valid for the facing block.
